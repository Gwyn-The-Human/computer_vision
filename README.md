# computer_vision

#FIRST MILESTONE 

#Trained a model from https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ to recognise three classes (rock, paper, scissors and none) trained on about 3000 images for each class)
#The model is saved as keras_model.h5.
#I'll be using the model to build a rock-paper-scissors game in which the computer will use compture vision to play against me! But I will win anyway!
